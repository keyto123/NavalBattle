# NavalBattle
It's a naval battle game using java's swing for GUI implementation.

All .java files were written by Lucas Mateus Gon√ßalves(keyto123) while resources were made by Vitor Henrique(viwnj). 
There is a tutorial to the game inside resource folder.

Requires jdk 8 since there are lambdas through the code.
